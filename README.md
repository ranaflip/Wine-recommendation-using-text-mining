🍷 A Taste of French Wine: Text Mining and Recommendation System
🌟 Project Overview
This project explores a dataset of over 130 thousand wine reviews sourced from Wine Enthusiast to analyze the characteristics and regional origins of French wines. It combines Text Mining, advanced Aroma Analysis, and Machine Learning classification to provide insights into consumer preferences and build a unique content-based recommendation system.

🎯 Objectives
Summarize French Wine Status: Analyze and present the status of French wine within the Wine Enthusiast dataset.

Aroma Component Analysis: Calculate the distinct aroma profile (component percentages) for wines originating from different French regions (e.g., Bordeaux, Burgundy).

Regional Recommendation System: Apply L2 distance to recommend consumers a wine origin that possesses an aroma component similar to a wine they are currently exploring.

Region Classification Comparison: Compare the performance of two distinct machine learning techniques—Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)—to categorize a wine description to its region of origin.
